# Vecpad
Vecpad is an open-source linear algebra visualiser tool used mainly in computer graphics. It's an educationnal tool that was developped as a projet during my bachelor's degree at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. If you found a bug, submit an issue and I'll see what I can do. For any help please refer to the wiki!
